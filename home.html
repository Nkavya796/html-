A little about ourselves
Skylight University is a small township in itself.
 Rich in natural flora and fauna to begin with, the campus' green cover has been maintained and even increased over the years.
 An island of green in the otherwise concrete jungle that is Mumbai, the campus at Powai nestles among hills and is flanked by the Powai and Vihar lakes.<BR>
 It is special both in terms of its physical beauty and location â€” a place where you can be away from the busy world, yet still be a part of it. 
 Education and research are the twin pillars of this institute and the ambience is one in which new ideas and creativity can flourish. </BR></P>
